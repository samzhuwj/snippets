>Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

#### Definition:

the pointer is "points to" any other type.

the reference is "another name" of an **object**.

#### Key Difference:

1. a reference is another name of an **already existing** object.
a pointer is an object in its **own right**.
2. Once initialized, a reference remains **bound to** its initial object.
There is **no way** to rebind a reference to refer to a different object.
a pointer can be **assigned** and **copied**.
3. a reference always get the object to which the reference was initially bound.
a single pointer can point to **several different objects** over its lifetime.
4. a reference must be initialized.
a pointer need **not be** initialized at the time it is defined.

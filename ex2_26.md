>Which of the following are legal? For those that are illegal,
explain why.

```cpp
const int buf;      // illegal, buf is uninitialized const.
int cnt = 0;        // legal.
const int sz = cnt; // legal.
++cnt;              // legal.
++sz;               // illegal, attempt to write to const object(sz).
```

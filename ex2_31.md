>Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine
whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or
low-level const applies in each case.

```cpp
r1 = v2; // legal, top-level const in v2 is ignored.
p1 = p2; // illegal, p2 has a low-level const but p1 doesn't.
p2 = p1; // legal, we can convert int* to const int*.
p1 = p3; // illegal, p3 has a low-level const but p1 doesn't.
p2 = p3; // legal, p2 has the same low-level const qualification as p3.
```

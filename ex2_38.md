>Describe the differences in type deduction between decltype and auto. Give an example of an expression where auto and decltype will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce differing types.

The way `decltype` handles top-level const and references differs **subtly** from the way `auto` does.
Another important difference between `decltype` and `auto` is that the deduction done by decltype depends on the **form** of its given expression.

so the key of difference is **subtly** and **form**.

```cpp
int i = 0, &r = i;
// same
auto a = i;
decltype(i) b = i;
// different "c" will be int "d" will be int&
auto c = r;
decltype(r) d = r;
```

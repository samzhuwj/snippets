>What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables?
```cpp
std::string global_str;
int global_int;
int main()
{
    int local_int;
    std::string local_str;
}
```

`global_str` is global variable, so the value is empty string.
`global_int` is global variable, so the value is zero.
`local_int` is a local variable which is uninitialized, so it has a undefined value.
`local_str` is also a local variable which is uninitialized, but it has a value that is defined by the class. So it is empty string.
PS: please read P44 in the English version, P40 in Chinese version to get more.
The note: Uninitialized objects of built-in type defined inside a function body have a undefined value. Objects of class type that we do not explicitly inititalize have a value that is defined by class.

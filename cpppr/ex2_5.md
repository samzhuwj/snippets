## ex2_5
> Determine the type of each of the following literals. Explain
the differences among the literals in each of the four examples:
- (a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"
- (b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC
- (c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L
- (d) 10, 10u, 10., 10e-2

(a): character literal, wide character literal, string literal, string wide character literal.

(b): decimal, unsigned decimal, long decimal, unsigned long decimal, octal, hexadecimal.

(c): double, float, long double.

(d): decimal, unsigned decimal, double, double.

## ex2_6
> What, if any, are the differences between the following
definitions:
```cpp
int month = 9, day = 7;
int month = 09, day = 07;
```

The first line's integer is decimal.

The second line:

1. `int month = 09` is invalid, cause octal don't have digit `9`.
2. `day` is octal.

## ex2_7
> What values do these literals represent? What type does each
have?
- (a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012"
- (b) 3.14e1L
- (c) 1024f
- (d) 3.14L

(a): Who goes with Fergus?(new line) "string"

(b): 31.4 "long double"

(c): ERROR: The suffix f is valid only with floating point literals

(d): 3.14 "long double"

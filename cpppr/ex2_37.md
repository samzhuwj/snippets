>Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand. That is, if i is an int, then the type of the expression i = x is int&. Using that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code:
```cpp
int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype(a = b) d = a;
```

`c` is an int, `d` is a reference of int.
the value: a=3, b=4, c=3, d=3

>For each of the following declarations indicate whether the
object being declared has top-level or low-level const.
```cpp
const int v2 = 0; int v1 = v2;
int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1;
const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;
```

v2 is top-level const.
p2 is low-level const.
p3 is both low-level and top-level const.
r2 is low-level const.

>Why is the initialization of p legal but that of lp illegal?

```cpp
int i = 42;
void *p = &i;
long *lp = &i;
```

Inherited from C, `void*` is a special pointer that may point to any type, hence the second line is legal.
For type safety, C++ forbids implicit conversions like `long *lp = &i;`, thus such code is illegal.

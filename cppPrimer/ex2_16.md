>Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If they are valid, explain what they do.

    int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;
- (a) r2 = 3.14159;
- (b) r2 = r1;
- (c) i = r2;
- (d) r1 = d;

(a): valid. let d equal 3.14159.
(b): valid. automatic convert will happen.
(c): valid. but value will be truncated.
(d): valid. but value will be truncated.

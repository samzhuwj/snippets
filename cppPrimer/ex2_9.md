- (a) std::cin >> int input_value;
- (b) int i = { 3.14 };
- (c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;
- (d) int i = 3.14;

(a): error: expected '(' for function-style cast or type construction.
```cpp
int input_value = 0;
std::cin >> input_value;
```

(b):---when you compile the code without the argument "-std=c++11", you will get the warning below:
    warning: implicit conversion from 'double' to 'int' changes value from 3.14 to 3.
---when you compile the code using "-std=c+11", you will get a error below:
    error: type 'double' cannot be narrowed to 'int' in initializer list
---conclusion: Obviously, list initialization becomes strict in c++11.
```cpp
double i = { 3.14 };
```

(c): --if you declared 'wage' before, it's right. Otherwise, you'll get a error:
    error: use of undeclared identifier 'wage'
```cpp
double wage;
double salary = wage = 9999.99;
```

(d): ok: but value will be truncated.
```cpp
double i = 3.14;
```
